# Python for Data Analysis by Wes McKinny Chapter 1 Key Points

- This book mainly deal's with essential python programming for data analysis.
- Along with the general purpose software engineering python libraries such as **pandas,numpy,scikit-learn** etc made python more popular for data analysis.
- Code written in C/C++ and FORTRAN can be integrated with each other with the help of python.
- Instead of using two development environments for prototype and production systems python can be used as a replacement for both.
- As the python interpreter prevents from executing more than one instruction at a time (GIL(Global Interpreter)) programming in python is less suitable in case of processing big    data applications.
- Numpy is a very handy library in case of numerical computation in python.
- Numpy arrays are interoperatable without copying the data into someother memory location.
- Pandas is used for data manipulation where as matplotlib can be used for data visualization.
